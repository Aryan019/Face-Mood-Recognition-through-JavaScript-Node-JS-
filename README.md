😃 Mood Recognizer Project
Welcome to the Mood Recognizer Project! This project, made with the power of JavaScript, 
can recognize your mood, age, and gender confidence percentage using the magic of face recognition. 
It's like having a mini-therapist right in your browser! 🤖

📸 What It Does
This project uses your webcam to detect and display:
•	Your mood (e.g., happy, sad, surprised, etc.) 🥳😢😮
•	Your age 👶👦🧑👴
•	Your gender with a confidence percentage 🧑🚻

🛠️ How It Works
1.	JavaScript is the hero here, handling all the logic and webcam magic! 🦸‍♂️
2.	We use the awesome face-api.js library to load pre-trained models for face detection and recognition.
3.	The webcam feed is processed to detect faces, landmarks, age, gender, and expressions.
4.	All the cool data is then drawn on a canvas overlay for your viewing pleasure. 📹🎨
